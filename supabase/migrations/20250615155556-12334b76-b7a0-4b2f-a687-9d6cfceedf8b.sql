The process, following initial pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, aims to overcome overfitting and enable the model to respond appropriately to new prompts. RLHF achieves this by: Generating multiple responses to a prompt. Collecting human preferences (feedback) on these responses. Training a reward model based on these human preferences. Using this reward model to further train the original LLM, allowing it to generate polite and helpful answers to new, unseen prompts efficiently.'
